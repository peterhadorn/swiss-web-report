# raising it made things worse) but each domain's own critical path. This
# shared, bounded pool lets independent queries WITHIN one domain's scan run
# concurrently instead.
#
# Sizing this is NOT independent of --concurrency (dmarc_scan.py's outer
# thread count): once most of a domain's queries route through this pool
# (roughly 21 of ~27 today — everything except MX, MX-host A/AAAA, and
# TLSA), aggregate scan throughput follows Little's Law against the
# AVERAGE in-flight query count, which becomes governed by this pool's
# size, not by --concurrency. Pairing a small pool with a large outer
# --concurrency silently caps throughput below what --concurrency alone
# used to provide. Empirically: outer concurrency 700 alone already
# triggered a resolver-side error-rate spike, so this should stay near
# that same total in-flight ceiling (~300), not be raised independently —
# tune both together, not one in isolation.
